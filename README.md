Gavl Company focuses on broadcasting live auctions through a platform creating a transparent and well-informed working environment for real estate agents, vendors, and buyers. This project is to develop the web application that generates videos of reduced length in order to highlight the most significant parts of the auction. The Auction video is trimmed based on the JSON data available exclusively for all the auction through GAVL API and the video can be later customized based on the time range slider. A client-side web application provides features like Preview, Preview all and Generate to show the personalized form of auction video. On the server side of the web application Python, FFmpeg and other web application frameworks are used to process the Auction video based on the number of bids and the time allocated for it and the application is hosted on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.  Different project management tools such as Slack, GitHub, and Trello are used to work collaboratively and keep track of the tasks.
